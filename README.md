## Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing different deep learning models. Each model is organized into its respective directory, containing Jupyter Notebooks that provide step-by-step explanations and code implementations.

## Implemented Models

The repository includes the following models:

- **Adversarial Attacks and Training**: Techniques to make models robust against adversarial examples.
- **CIFAR10 Classification**: Image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using various architectures.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Implementation of CNNs for image processing tasks.
- **DINO**: Self-supervised learning with knowledge distillation.
- **Diffusion Models**: Probabilistic models for data generation.
- **GPT**: Generative Pre-trained Transformer for natural language processing.
- **Generative Models**: Various models for data generation tasks.
- **Masked Language Modeling and BERT**: Techniques for training language models with masked inputs.
- **Object Detection with YOLO**: Real-time object detection using the YOLO architecture.
- **Optimization Methods**: Various optimization algorithms used in training deep learning models.
- **RNN-LSTM**: Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequence data.
- **Stable Diffusion**: Techniques for stable training of diffusion models.
- **Transformer**: Implementation of the Transformer model for sequence transduction tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with these models:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AHNakbari/Deep-Learning-Models.git
   cd Deep-Learning-Models
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Explore the Notebooks**:
   - Navigate to the directory of the model you're interested in.
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the implementation and run the code.

## Usage

Each directory contains a Jupyter Notebook that:

- Provides an overview of the model.
- Explains the theoretical background.
- Contains code implementations with detailed comments.
- Demonstrates training and evaluation processes.
- Includes visualizations to aid understanding.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of each model.
